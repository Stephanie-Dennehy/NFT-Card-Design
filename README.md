## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was good practice for me with my CSS skills. I really didn't have a hard time with the HTML. But some of the CSS items took me some time to figure out. 


### Continued development

I want to continue to work on my HTML to make sure it's best practice and accessible. I also want to continue to improve my CSS skills so that I can make a similar project in less time in the future.
